A common rule of thumb for server administration is never type the same command twice; if you have to repeat something then you script it. But what if you have to type that same command over multiple machines? What if those machines aren't all in the same state and need additional packages installed? What about new machines that are being brought online? Over time those scripts become a management nightmare. One solution is Ansible. Ansible makes it easy to keep machines in a consistent state (think "make" for machines). And it uses tools you should already be using (Python and SSH). Craig Maloney will discuss how to get started with Ansible and show how a few simple commands can get your machines humming along and singing from the same songsheet.
